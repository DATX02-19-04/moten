### title
* What we have done
  - The PCB can be used to play games on a computer (meaning that the circuitboard and communication with a computer works)
  - We have decided that the main focus of the report should be energy efficency and cost. Some points on ergonomics are included as well.
  - We have a prototype for the physical design.

* Design feedback
  - Since the right button layout is not present on existing controllers, it is a good addition to the report
  - do a small user study where you compare your design to the original.
  - this might involve having users press buttons in a certain pattern
  - such a study should be developed along with the supervisor

* Problem with the software
  - Prioritize problems that affect the power consumption
