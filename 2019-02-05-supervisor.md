# Meeting \#5-Supervisor
Start: 11:00 \
Slut: XX:XX \
Datum: 2019-02-05

## Report
### Focus
* Be clear on that we are focusing on power and cost
* Survay of existing controllers (Crosscorelate):
   - Power
   - Cost
   - Physical design

### Studie
* 

### Comparisons
* Price
* Power consumption
* Ergonomics


## Scope
### Power
* How much power are normal controllers using today?
* How much would we be able to decrease
* Why current controllers use as much power as they do?
* Literature
   - Power efficient programming
   - Power efficient electronics

### Price
* Current pricing
* How much we could save
   - Estimating production cost
   - Estimate profit margin
* Literature
   - Electronical design
   - Manufactoring processes
   - Existing products

### Design
* Existing/new
* Test different
   - User studies
   - Identify the problems with existing controllers by asking users
   - Provide them with some existing solution and see how they feel
   - the goal is to first gather data, then make improvements based on observations
   - data can also be gathered from other controllers and feedback from their users
* Be clear about our scope and competence
* Design references
   - 
* How the manufactoring processes and desging affect the price and durability

## Procedure
* Order things
   - Existing controllers
   - Devboard
* Test the existing
   - Power consumption
* Estimate our own
   - Measuring devboard
   - How can we minimize it for the prototype?
* Compare
* Design a prototype
* Test our prototype
* Compare it to the existing
